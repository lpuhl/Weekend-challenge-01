The lecture itself is broken into four parts.

1. Introduction

2. Selectors
  2. `JQ-SEL`: DOM review, selecting elements with jQuery, basic usage, DOM traversal, getter/setter with .text()
3. Events
  3. `JQ-EVT`: Event handling, use of .on(), appending, add/remove class
4. Forms
  4. `JQ-FRM`: Form submission event handling and appending to the DOM, .data()
